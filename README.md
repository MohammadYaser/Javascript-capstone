# 📖 Javascript Capstone <a name="about-project"></a>
<br>
<br>
The JavaScript Capstone project, a collaborative effort between myself and my teammate Yonas, showcases our skills and knowledge acquired during our studies. This web application highlights our critical thinking, problem-solving, and research abilities, offering a dynamic platform for exploring, "liking," and commenting on meal data sourced through an API.

Using technologies such as JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS, and API integration, we've created an intuitive and efficient user interface. This platform enables users to search, interact with, and comment on their favorite meals, making it an essential resource for food enthusiasts and culinary explorers. Our commitment to continuous learning and effective teamwork shines through in the JavaScript Capstone project, reflecting our dedication to crafting innovative and user-friendly web applications.
